# Let's Make a Classroom!

Read [Collaboration.md](./COLLABORATION.md) to contribute.
## Description

The hardest part of learning to programming is knowing where to start.

"Classroom" (working title) is a site in the vein of
(codeawway.io)[https://www.codeaway.io/] where programmers who are just starting off can find simple projects to get them going.
## Philosophy

In creating classroom, we want to embrace a few philosophies:

### Coversational

We'd like to make a site that works with the user to find the best way of learning, rather than dictating what the user should be doing. "Conversation, not clinical".

### Choose your own adventure

We'd like to create a site that allows people to not only work at their own pace; but to design how they would like to work. We might achieve this in future by asking the user a series of questions that provides a roadmap of projects that allows them to learn on their own custom path.
## Roadmap

We've outlined **Phase 1** for now. As the project grows, we'll outline more and more details in **Phase 2**, **Phase 3**, and beyond.
### Phase 1

Phase 1 is pretty straight forward.

It will consist of two pages:

A main page explaining what "Classroom" is all about (index.html) and second page listing projects (projects.html).
