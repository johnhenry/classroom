### Installation

This will install any dependencies -- namely live server -- that are required to open a page locally.

```bash
npm run install
```

### Serve

This will run a server that renders locally edited files.

```

This will start a server at <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">localhost:8080</a>. Edit and save files in `./src/` to cause refresh.
